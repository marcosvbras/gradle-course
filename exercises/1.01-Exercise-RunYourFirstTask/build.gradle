/*

In this simple Gradle build script we have defined a single task named "hello". The task's action simply prints the string "Hello World" to the standard output.

Since we haven't installed Gradle yet, we'll execute this task using the Gradle wrapper. The wrapper is a script that will download and install a specified version of Gradle.

To run the task below, just type:
./gradlew hello

*/

task hello {
    description "This is my first task on Gradle!"
    group "Our demo"
    doLast {
        println "Hello World!"
    }
}
